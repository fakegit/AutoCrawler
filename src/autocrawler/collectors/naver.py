    NOTE: Verified against the live DOM on 2026-08-30. Two bugs were found and
    fixed:

    1. The viewer image now renders with two classes
       (`_fe_image_viewer_image_fallback_target _fe_image_viewer_main_image`),
       so the old exact-match `@class="..."` XPath no longer matched anything -
       switched to `contains()`.
    2. Re-reading the viewer image's src right after `Keys.RIGHT` mostly just
       re-read the *previous* image's still-current src, since Naver hadn't
       swapped it in yet - measured 0 new links across 60 iterations without a
       wait. Now waits (up to 5s) for the src to actually change from the last
       one collected before treating it as loaded - measured 80/80 with this
       in place. Also now stops once `config.limit` is reached, matching
       `collect_google_full` (previously ignored the limit entirely).
