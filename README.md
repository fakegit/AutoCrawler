# AutoCrawler
Google, Naver multiprocess image crawler (High Quality & Speed & Customizable)

![](docs/animation.gif)

# How to use

1. Install Chrome

2. `pip install -e .` (installs the `autocrawler` package and its dependencies)

3. Write search keywords in keywords.txt

4. **Run `autocrawler`** (or `python -m autocrawler`, or `python main.py` for backwards compatibility)

5. Files will be downloaded to the 'download' directory.


# Arguments
usage:
```
autocrawler [--skip] [--threads 4] [--google] [--naver] [--full] [--face] [--no_gui auto] [--limit 0]
```

```
--skip / --no-skip     Skip a keyword if its download directory already exists. (default: --skip)
                       This is needed when re-downloading.

--threads 4            Number of worker processes to download with.

--google / --no-google Download from google.com. (default: --google)

--naver / --no-naver   Download from naver.com. (default: --naver)

--full / --no-full     Download full resolution image instead of thumbnails (slow). (default: --no-full)

--face / --no-face     Face search mode. (default: --no-face)

--no_gui auto|true|false   No GUI mode. (headless mode) Acceleration for full_resolution mode, but unstable on thumbnail mode.
                           Default: "auto" - false if --full is not set, true if --full is set.
                           (can be used for docker linux system)

--limit 0              Maximum count of images to download per site. (0: infinite)
--proxy-list ''        The comma separated proxy list like: "socks://127.0.0.1:1080,http://127.0.0.1:1081".
                       Every task randomly chooses one from the list.
--download-path        Download folder path. (default: download)
--keywords-file        Path to the search keywords file. (default: keywords.txt)
```

> **Note:** as of v2.0, the boolean flags (`--skip`, `--google`, `--naver`, `--full`, `--face`) use
> `--flag`/`--no-flag` pairs instead of `--flag true`/`--flag false`. `--no_gui` is unchanged.


# Full Resolution Mode

You can download full resolution image of JPG, GIF, PNG files by specifying --full true

# Data Imbalance Detection

Detects data imbalance based on number of files.

When crawling ends, the message show you what directory has under 50% of average files.

I recommend you to remove those directories and re-download.


# Remote crawling through SSH on your server

```
sudo apt-get install xvfb <- This is virtual display

sudo apt-get install screen <- This will allow you to close SSH terminal while running.

screen -S s1

Xvfb :99 -ac & DISPLAY=:99 autocrawler
```

# Customize

You can make your own crawler by changing the collectors under `src/autocrawler/collectors/`
(`google.py`, `naver.py`, and the shared helpers in `base.py`).

# How to fix issues

As Google/Naver's sites consistently change, you may need to fix the XPath selectors in
`src/autocrawler/collectors/google.py` or `src/autocrawler/collectors/naver.py`.

1. Go to google image. [https://www.google.com/search?q=dog&source=lnms&tbm=isch](https://www.google.com/search?q=dog&source=lnms&tbm=isch)
2. Open devloper tools on Chrome. (CTRL+SHIFT+I, CMD+OPTION+I)
3. Designate an image to capture.

4. Checkout `src/autocrawler/collectors/google.py` / `naver.py`

5. Docs for XPATH usage: [https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp)
6. You can test XPATH using CTRL+F on your chrome developer tools.

7. You need to find logic to crawling to work.

As of 2026-08, the thumbnail-mode selectors (`collect_google`/`collect_naver`) were re-verified
against the live DOM and updated. The full-resolution selectors (`collect_google_full`/
`collect_naver_full`) have **not** been re-verified and may need the same treatment — see the
`NOTE` comments at the top of each collector module.

## "chromedriver" hangs or never starts (macOS)

If `chromedriver` hangs indefinitely (even when run standalone, outside this project) or the
process ends up stuck and unkillable, macOS Gatekeeper may be rejecting it — chromedriver
binaries (from `webdriver-manager` or Homebrew) are typically ad-hoc signed with no Team
Identifier, and recent macOS versions increasingly reject unnotarized binaries outright. Check
with:

```
spctl -a -vv "$(which chromedriver)"
```

If it prints `rejected`: on macOS 15+, `spctl --add` (the classic per-file exception) no longer
works (`This operation is no longer supported`) — the only remaining override is
`sudo spctl --global-disable`, which reveals an "allow apps downloaded from anywhere" toggle in
System Settings → Privacy & Security, plus an "Open Anyway" confirmation the next time the
binary runs. In practice, just running `chromedriver` once directly in an interactive Terminal
(not through a script) got it trusted without needing that toggle at all, so try that first.

If a chromedriver you've already gotten trusted (e.g. via Homebrew, on PATH) still gets rejected
inside this project, note that `build_driver()` prefers a `chromedriver` already on PATH over
downloading a separate copy via `webdriver-manager` — but each *distinct binary/path* needs its
own Gatekeeper trust, so a copy webdriver-manager downloaded under `~/.wdm/` is a different file
and needs to be approved separately from one on PATH.

## Google shows a CAPTCHA / "unusual traffic" page

Google's bot-detection is IP-reputation based, not just per-browser: hitting it with a burst of
automated requests (including just testing/debugging) can get your IP flagged for a while, during
which a fresh browser process may be asked to solve a CAPTCHA again even with valid cookies.

### How solving it works

This works the same regardless of `--threads` - no need to drop to `--threads 1` for this part,
since it all happens before any worker processes start:

1. Before crawling starts, `autocrawler` opens **one visible Chrome window** against Google in the
   main process (this warm-up only targets Google — Naver hasn't been observed to CAPTCHA-block
   this crawler), using a persistent profile at `./chrome-profile`.
2. If that window shows a CAPTCHA, the terminal prints:
   ```
   CAPTCHA detected at https://www.google.com/sorry/index?...
   Solve the CAPTCHA in the open Chrome window, then press Enter here to continue...
   ```
   Switch to the Chrome window, solve it (checkbox and/or image challenge), then come back to the
   terminal and press **Enter**. The detector polls for a few seconds before giving up, since the
   CAPTCHA widget itself can take a moment to render — if it seems to skip past a CAPTCHA before
   you can click anything, it likely just hadn't rendered yet in that window.
3. Once solved, the cookies are saved into `./chrome-profile`. Each crawl task then gets its own
   temporary **copy** of that profile (Chrome won't let two processes share one profile directory),
   so the warmed-up cookies carry over to every task — including when running with multiple
   `--threads` — without them colliding on the same profile.
